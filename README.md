# BankSim



### Purpose
When the project is run, it will create a single "bank" along with multiple "accounts". Each of these
accounts have some balance in them and a user can interact with his/her own account by despositing money, 
withdrawing money, or displaying the balance. There is also the ability to transfer funds from one account to another.

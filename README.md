# BankSim



### Purpose
When the project is run, it will create a single "bank" along with multiple "accounts". Each of these
accounts have some balance in them and a user can interact with his/her own account by despositing money, 
withdrawing money, or displaying the balance. The primary purpose of these interactions for the project
is to allow for transfering of funds between accounts by first withdrawing a sum from one account to verify
it has the required amount, then depositing that amount into another account.
